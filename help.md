Welcome to our help page. Here you will find all the information you need in order for you to use our extension. Have fun!


WHAT IS IT?
===============
EFTAS stands for "Enhanced File Tagging System" and can be used to add tags to files and directories. With them, you can manage all your different documents and only see, what you want to see at the moment.


USAGE
===============
Using our extension is very simple. Just type eftas <operation>.

The different operations you can execute are:
- mkfile <tag_name> <tag_value> <file_path> -> creates a file with the specified tagname and -value. If the file already exists, then it will just add the tag to that file.
- lsDifferent2 <nothing,-a,tag_name> -> shows you files in different ways
	- nothing will utilize the ls command and will show you files in your current directory
	- -a will show you all the files
	- tagname will show you the files with that tagname from your current directory
- deleteTag <tag_name> <file_path> -> deletes a tag from a file
- listAll <file_path> -> lists all tags that the specified file has


BUGS
===============
There are no bugs, just happy little accidents :)


TEAM
===============
We are two computer science students from the university of Basel and created this file extension as a project for one of our courses.
