# Project Diary
### Project idea
In a previous discussion we picked several project ideas. Some being: creating out own game emulator, building a keylogger to save common terminal commands and creating our own file system extension. 
We decided to go with the file system because that seems like a realistic project and because other project topics were already taken by other groups. (The lecture only allows 2 groups per project topic).
