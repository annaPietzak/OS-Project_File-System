# Project Diary
### Project idea
In a previous discussion we picked several project ideas. Some being: creating out own game emulator, building a keylogger to save common terminal commands and creating our own file system extension. 
We decided to go with the file system because that seems like a realistic project and because other project topics were already taken by other groups. (The lecture only allows 2 groups per project topic).

### Deadlines
* 03.04 10:00   | hand in of prject presentation
* 04.04 / 05.04 | give Project presentation

* 13.06 / 14.06 | give final project presentation


### 20.03.2024
Next steps: 
We will each research how to implement out project and meet again on the **27.03.2024** to discuss our findings.

For the presentation we need:
* timeplan and distribution of tasks
* proposal of a solution 
* list of ressources (libraries, etc.) that we might need

### 27.03.2024 discussing the next steps
